## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I just learned about Flexboxes and using them and some other CSS properties in this challange helped me to consolidate my learnings. Also I learned how to overlay a image or any other property on top of a container and show it with a trigger like a hover.


### Continued development

Since I am still learning layouts and responsive design I will continue to learn these topics and try to build harder and more complex layouts.

### Useful resources

- [Image Overlay Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exb2ab72Xhs) - This video helped me to build overlaying effect. Great explanation.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - Had to check a lot of stuff from the docs because I keep forgetting them.
